# VBA Faster String Quick Sort
 * This module provides a method for sorting a flat String array (1D array).
 * It uses a tweaked version of Quick Sort by replacing direct String swappings with indirect String pointer swappings.
 * It also utilizes some additinal speed optimizations.

It works on either **`32/64-bit`**, and on any **`(MS Office`** versions and platforms (**`Windows`** or **`Mac`**).  
It also works on **`TwinBasic`**.
